## Installation
As described in the [TensorFlow docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#step-by-step_instructions), it is best practice to install `careless` in a fresh [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) environment to avoid conflicts with previously installed dependencies. 

Create a new environment using the following commands.
```bash
conda create -yn careless python
conda activate careless
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now install `careless` for CPU, 
```bash
pip install careless
```
or for NVIDIA GPUs
```bash
pip install careless[cuda]
```
You may run `careless devices` to check whether GPU support was successfully installed. If you run into issues please [File an issue](https://github.com/rs-station/careless/issues/new/choose).



## Installation with GPU Support
Careless supports GPU acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs through the CUDA library. We strongly encourage users to take advantage of this feature. To streamline installation, we maintain a script which installs careless with CUDA support. The following section will guide you through installing careless for the GPU. 


## Dependencies

`careless` is likely to run on any operating system and python version which is compatible with TensorFlow. 
`careless` uses mostly tools from the conventional scientific python stack plus
 - optimization routines from [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - statistical distributions from [Tensorflow-Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)
 - crystallographic computing resources from 
    - [ReciprocalSpaceship](https://rs-station.github.io/reciprocalspaceship/)
    - [GEMMI](https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


`careless` does not require but may take advantage of various accelator cards supported by TensorFlow.

## Get Help
For help with command line arguments, type `careless mono --help` for monochromatic or `careless poly --help` for Laue processing options. 

For usage examples and data from the `careless` [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.425510), check out [careless-examples](https://github.com/rs-station/careless-examples). For a detailed case study of `careless` processing including information about **crossvalidation measures**, see our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.30.605871).

## Core Model

![pgm](doc/figures/pgm.svg)

`careless` uses approximate Bayesian inference to merge X-ray diffraction data. 
The model which is implemented in `careless` tries to scale individual reflection observations such that they become consistent with a set of prior beliefs.
During optimization of a model, `careless` trades off between consistency of the merged structure factor amplitudes with the data and consistency with the priors.
In essence, the optimizer tries to strike a compromise which maximizes the likelihood of the observed data while not straying far from the prior distributions. 

The implementation breaks the model down into 4 types of objects. 

### Variational Merging Model
The `VariationalMergingModel` is central object which houses the estimates of the merged structure factors.
In `careless` merged structure factors are represented by truncated normal distributions which have support on (0, ∞).
According to French and Wilson<sup>[2](#frenchwilson)</sup> this is the appropriate parameterization for acentric reflections which are by far the majority in most space groups.
These distributions are stored in the `VariationalMergingModel.surrogate_posterior` attribute. 
They serve as a parametric approximation of the true posterior which cannot easily be calculated. 
It has utility methods for training the model.
It contains an instance of each of the other objects. 
During optimization, the loss function is constructed by sampling values for the merged structure factors and scales these are combined with the prior and likelihood to compute the `Evidence Lower BOund` or (`ELBO`)
Gradiennt ascent is used to maximize the `ELBO`.

### Priors
The simplest prior which `careless` implements are the popular priors<sup>[1](#wilson)</sup> derived by A. J. C. Wilson from the random atom model. 
This is a relatively weak prior, but it is sufficient in practice for many types of crystallographic data. 
`careless` will include support for reference and multivariate priors in future releases. 

### Likelihoods
The quality of the current structure factor estimates during optimization is judged by a likelihood function. 
These are symmetric probability distributions centered at the observed reflection observation. 
`careless` includes normally-distributed and robust, t-distributed likelihoods. 

### Scaling Models
Right now the only model which `careless` explicitly implements is a sequential neural network model. 
This model takes reflection metadata as input and outputs a gaussian distribution of likely scale values for each reflection.

Special metadata keys for scaling. 
`careless` will parse any existing metadata keys in the input Mtz(s). 
During configuration some new metadata keys will be populated that are useful in many instances. 
 - <b>dHKL</b> : The inverse square of the reflection resolution. Supplying this key is a convenient way to parameterize isotropic scaling.
 - <b>file_id</b> : An integer ID unique to each input Mtz. 
 - <b>image_id</b> : An integer ID unique to each image across all input Mtzs. 
 - <b>{H,K,L}obs</b> : Internally, `careless` refers to the original miller indices from indexing as `Hobs`, `Kobs`, and `Lobs`. Supplying these three keys is the typical method to enable anisotropic scaling. 


### Considerations when choosing metadata. 
 - <b>Polarization correction</b> : Careless does not apply a specific polarization correction. 
   In order to be sure the model accounts for polarization, it is important to supply the x,y 
   coordinates of each reflection observation. 
 - <b>Isotropic scaling</b> : This is easily accounted for by supplying the 'dHKL' metadata key.
 - <b>Interleaved rotation series</b> : Most properly formatted Mtzs have a "Batch" column which contains a unique id for each image. 
   Importantly, these are usually in order. If you have time resolved data with multiple timepoints per angle, you may
   want to use the "Batch" key in conjunction with the "file_id" key. This way images from the same rotation angle will
   be constrained to scale more similarly. 
 - <b>Multi crystal scaling</b> : For scaling multiple crystals, it is best if image identifiers in the metadata do not overlap. Therefore, use the 'image_id' key.
